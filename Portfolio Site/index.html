               Hi! My name is Morgan and this is a portfolio website about me. Now, it shows more of that I've accomplished than who I am. So, I'll start off telling you a few things about me: 
               I LOVE photography. A picture means so much more to me then simply clicking a button. Each picture stops time. Each is a memory. Has a feeling. You can change so many lives with a simple picture. I have a passion for reading. Books are my escape from the everyday world. For minutes or hours, you can get lost in a battle or in space.
